## A tool to make budgeting easier

This application is designed to represent a simple personal
budgeting tool that anyone can use to improve their money management skills.
As inflation continues to rise and costs increase, it is becoming more important
to understand how to budget properly in order to prevent financial-related issues.
The demographic for this application can be anyone aged above 13 ranging from young

- I wanted my project to be something that is applicable to a large demographic 
- As a computer science student who is learning, I wanted my project to help my develop my technical skills

add expenses and sources of income to create a balance sheet of each month of the year.
The application will be visually appealing with a high contrast for readability.
